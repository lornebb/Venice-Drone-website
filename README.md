Need to get an example read me to use! 

9th May -
- need to figure out nav bar invisibility... 
- holy shit balls, finally figured out the background thing and it looks wicked! 
- nav bar look a bit better with skeleton.. not 100% ure how to contain things within the columns. 
- slept with this project in my head. After reading most of the Dont make me think book, I know what to do now. 

8th may - 
- found a boilerplate that could help me that is basic stuff and wont over saturate the vibe of the page called Skeleton. 
- this is mental tough
- 3rd re-start - this time, I am going to build on a blank frame work. No boiler plate stuff. 
  Let's see if I can make this on standard html and css. 
- lost everything 3 times now due to git hub crashing.
